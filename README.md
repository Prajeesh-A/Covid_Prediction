# COVID Life Change Prediction Model

This repository contains a machine learning model that predicts whether an individual is likely to experience significant lifestyle changes due to COVID-19. The model is trained on data such as demographics, health history, and behavioral patterns.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handles missing values, normalization, and feature encoding.
- **Model Training:** Uses advanced machine learning techniques for high accuracy.
- **Prediction Output:** Classifies lifestyle change likelihood as "Significant" or "Minimal."
- **Customizable:** Easily adaptable to new datasets or additional features.
